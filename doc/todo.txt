Completed work
---------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE - Create basic workflow representation
DONE - Create fork, join and passthrough functions
DONE - Create notion of task queue.
DONE - Have node generate task in queue
DONE - Have console UI to view task in queue and complete tasks
DONE - Implement Node guards
DONE - Create workflow file format (not accounting for nested workflows)
DONE - Implement nested workflows (implemented via workflow composition)
DONE - Support named arcs for flow control
DONE - Database persistence
       Implemented relatively space efficient means of storing composed workflows in database
       Tokens provide flow history
DONE - Allow the token to carry state - will allow more interesting guards


In Progress:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Visualizations
Guard domain specific language

Next steps:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Investigate moving token marking from one version to next
More work with workflow graph composition.

Future posibilities:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Web UI
GTK UI
